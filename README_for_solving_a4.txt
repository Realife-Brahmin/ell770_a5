1. For solving q1 of a4, use test case '003_1'
2. For solving q2 of a4: use test cases '003_3' to '003_7' for solving (a) to (e), in that order.

Note: You'll be greeted with a message like 'This system is based on question 2 (a) of a4'.

Additional Note: 2 (c) is a Case III contingency. But I haven't bothered to implement Case3 script (refer to Notes in README). So in order to get the final answer, I simply modified the original busData values for that question in the excel file correspoinding to '003_5' to get the final answer.
